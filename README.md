Attemped at quickly recreating an old JRPG, turned in to development of an engine for tile based games. After about a month of development i decided to abandon it. I simply don't have enough time at the moment to spend it on developing an engine. After learning a bit of engine development i also realise how
bad my attemp is, i thought of starting over and maybe changing OOD to ECS, but ultimately i decided to drop attempts at creating my own engine and just learn how to work with
existing one.
